Welcome to piquid's documentation!
==================================

Piquid is a simple library that provides serialization functionality via a collection of base classes. It
supports JSON, BSON, Protobuf, and Pickle serialization. Each base class supports serialization to either objects in
memory or to a file path, and each is meant to be compatible with dataclasses.

The implementations of the classes in this library are quite simple and therefore limited. The intention is not to
present a library that can satisfy any use case. It is instead to present a pattern that can be used and improved upon
for simple "afterthought" style serialziation in Python.
